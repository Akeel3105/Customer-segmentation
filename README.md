# Customer-segmentation
Customer segmentation using PCA and other unsupervised ML algo
 1.    Derive some relevant insights(Min 4-5) out of the given data using different approaches
        Such as using Seaborn/Matplotlib or Cross tabulation.

  2.    Perform data pre-processing wherever needed.

  3.    Segmentation Using PCA.
  3.1.  Do necessary steps to apply PCA on the raw data.
  3.2.  Find number of optimat PCs to be considered.
  3.3.  Apply PCA using the optimal number.
  3.4.  Perform KMeans and Hierarchical clustering using Optimal number of clusters in both the cases on PCA transformed                       data.
   3.5.  Finally do a cluster analysis of each segment.

  4.    Segmentation without using PCA.
  4.1.  Take raw data as input and final number of optimal cluster for both KMeans and Hierarchical cluster.
  4.2.  Perform KMeans and Hierarchical clustering using Optimal number of clusters in both the cases.
  4.3.  Finally do a cluster analysis of each segment.
